# Deep Learning Models

This repository contains aplications of different deep learning models in multiple datasets. For now, it is just MNIST, but the idea is to keep updating with more datasets, models and frameworks (keras, pytorch, etc).

## MNIST
Hand-written digits as simple 28x28 images (1 channel). Models applied were sequential flat neural network and convolutional neural network.
